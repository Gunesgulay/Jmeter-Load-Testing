#Jmeter-Load-Testing

This project was created to perform load tests on the "https://petstore.swagger.io/" site using Apache JMeter.

‚óè Apache JMeter is an open-source, Java-based performance testing tool. JMeter is primarily used to test the performance of web applications, conduct load tests, and perform stress tests on various protocols. Through the CSV Data Set Config element in JMeter, you can extract data from CSV files and utilize this data in your test scenarios. By assigning the data from CSV files to variables, you can execute tests with different data sets, creating more realistic scenarios. This is particularly useful when dealing with diverse user information, parameter values, or other dynamic data.
